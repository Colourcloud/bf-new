        "brief": "We were asked to redesign the current CSSBuy mobile application, to create a more modern, easy to use version that their users would love. CSSBuy wanted to keep their current colour scheme with a few adjustments, but wanted us to decide on new typography and icons to use through the website. We started by looking through all the pages their current app has and broke them down to their core functionally, which would later be used in the design decisions.",

        "discovered": "The first thing we noticed was their current use of colour and typography. We really liked their current colour palette which matched their branding, however there were a lot of inconsistencies with different shades of the brand colour for buttons, highlights and text. So we wanted to really focus on fixing this.",
        "mobile_statement": "We were also tasked to redesign CSSBuy's mobile application to enhance the shopping experience for all their users. With a total of over 40+ pages, this was no small feat, but we were able to completely overhaul the design and deliver them a product not only they loved, but their customers aswell.",
        "closing_statement": "Following comprehensive evaluations of both the website and mobile application, we have garnered highly favorable responses from CSSBuy's user community, specifically in relation to the user experience and the structure of information architecture. Users reported that finding relevent information was a lot easier and streamlined, making the service a lot more enjoyable and easy to understand. We're going to continue working with CSSBuy to monitor the websites user engagement to ensure our product is delivering what we promised.",

        "brief": "Blank Canvas, a real estate photography, videography and marketing agency in Auckland, New Zealand asked us to design & develop a new website as their current one wasn’t hitting the mark. It was a tad outdated, had a few broken parts and wasn’t communicating their offers as well as it could have. They also wanted to include a booking system for their current or new clients. Our designer immediately saw a new vision for their site, using the full website spacing to show off the large images and videos they had for their portfolio.",

        "discovered": "On our inspection of the website we noticed a lot of broken links, missing pages and information. It looked as if they had tried to build in a booking system previously as it was present on the site but it wasn’t working. Their portfolio was hosted on a separate platform but this also wasn’t connected to the website. We intended to fix these things immediately, as well as cleaning up the design and user experience across the board.",
        "mobile_statement": "We redesigned their mobile layout, aiming to streamline the user experience and better showcase their stunning real estate photography and films. We focused on creating a sleek, intuitive design that highlights their visual content, making it easier for clients to explore and engage with their portfolio and services. The result was a modern, user-friendly app that perfectly reflects the high-quality services Blank Canvas Production offers to New Zealand real estate agents and agencies.",
        "closing_statement": "After finishing the new website project and mobile app Blank Canvas Production gave us good feedback and were happy with the outcome. Particularly regarding the improved user experience and navigation. Clients could access relevant information a lot easier, making their overall interaction with the production studios services a more positive experience.",

        "brief": "We were tasked to redesign and develop the new Construction Health & Safety New Zealand website in collaboration with PortGroup, a graphic design agency based in Auckland, NZ. The primary objective of this redesign was to enhance the user experience, enabling users to access resources more efficiently. Additionally, we aimed to clearly represent CHASNZ and its subsidiary brands throughout the website.",

        "discovered": "We began by evaluating the existing website to identify underperforming areas. It quickly became apparent that the site's navigation required significant improvement, as users had to click through multiple pages to reach their desired destinations. Additionally, we observed a lack of consistent branding in the imagery and color scheme. In response, PortGroup developed a new brand guideline aligned with CHASNZ's values and objectives. We then implemented this brand guideline throughout the site, streamlining the layout and enhancing overall usability.",
        "mobile_statement": "Given that many of Construction Health & Safety New Zealand’s site users primarily access their website from mobile devices, we prioritised creating a mobile-friendly UX that's both easy to navigate and visually appealing to their user base. Recognising that the website hosts lots of links to various learning material and resources that would be accessed by many different trades industries in NZ, we ensured that the site's resources were easily accessible on both mobile and desktop platforms. The new website design prominently features image material to showcase CHASNZ’s brand and objectives, so we also made certain that all images are visually appealing and optimised for all screen sizes.",
        "closing_statement": "Following an in-depth assessment of both the website and mobile experience, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from CHASNZ noting that navigating the site and finding relevant information is now significantly more intuitive and efficient, enhancing the overall experience. The improvements in the user interface and streamlined access to resources have been particularly well-received. As well as the visual representation of Construction Health & Safety New Zealand’s brand and objectives through imagery and design has resonated with users across all devices.",
